# Intro to a project

This project is a dashboard of startlist enteries.

The organiser is able to insert their name into the input box and it shows:

- The list of people in the race 
- The total revenue for the race.

This project uses HTML JavaScript and CSS bootstrap

If I had more time I would:

- Add filters to sort the different columns.
- Add the number of people in a race filtered by certain requirements eg if they are in the "The Great North Run" and they are confirmed ect.
- A way to indicate if someone has shown up for the race; essentially a virtual ticklist for the organisers to tick people off the list if they have arrived for the race.
- Email people who are pending to remind them to confirm their attendance to the race.
- Write some tests.
